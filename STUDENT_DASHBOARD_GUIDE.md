## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

**TestAttempt Table (New):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE TestAttempts (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    TestAllocationId INT FK,
    StudentId NVARCHAR FK,
    TestId INT FK,
    StartedAt DATETIME2,
    SubmittedAt DATETIME2 NULL,
    Status INT, -- NotStarted/InProgress/Submitted/TimeExpired
    CurrentQuestionIndex INT,
    LastActivityAt DATETIME2,
    ShuffledQuestionOrder NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL
)
```

**StudentAnswer Table (Enhanced):**
```sql
ALTER TABLE StudentAnswers 
ADD Status INT DEFAULT 0, -- Unvisited/Visited/Answered/MarkedForReview
    IsMarkedForReview BIT DEFAULT 0,
    AnsweredAt DATETIME2 NULL
```

---

### Answer Evaluation Logic

**Automatic on Submit:**
```csharp
foreach (var answer in studentAnswers)
{
    if (answer.AnswerText != null)
    {
        // Case-insensitive comparison
        answer.IsCorrect = answer.AnswerText.Trim()
            .Equals(question.CorrectAnswer.Trim(), 
                    StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
        
        // Award marks if correct
        if (answer.IsCorrect)
        {
            answer.MarksObtained = testQuestion.Marks;
        }
        else
        {
            answer.MarksObtained = 0;
        }
    }
}

// Calculate totals
result.ObtainedMarks = studentAnswers.Sum(a => a.MarksObtained);
result.Percentage = (decimal)obtainedMarks / totalMarks * 100;
result.IsPassed = obtainedMarks >= passingMarks;
```
