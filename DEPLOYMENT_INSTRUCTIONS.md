# üöÄ DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

## CET Exam Application v3.0 - Final Deployment

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Database Migration Required

This update adds the **Student Dashboard** and **Test Taking** features, which require new database tables and columns.

---

## üîß Step 1: Install Required Tools (If Not Already Installed)

```bash
# Install EF Core Tools (if not already installed)
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef

# OR Update if already installed
dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef
```

---

## üìä Step 2: Create and Apply Migration

### Option A: Using Terminal/Command Prompt

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "E:\ASP.Net Core\CETExamApp"

# Create the migration
dotnet ef migrations add AddStudentDashboardAndTestTaking

# Apply migration to database
dotnet ef database update
```

### Option B: Using Package Manager Console (Visual Studio)

```powershell
# In Visual Studio: Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console

Add-Migration AddStudentDashboardAndTestTaking
Update-Database
```

---

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Verify Migration Success

After running the migration, verify these changes were applied:

### New Table Created:
- **TestAttempts** (8 columns)
  - Id, TestAllocationId, StudentId, TestId
  - StartedAt, SubmittedAt, Status
  - CurrentQuestionIndex, LastActivityAt
  - ShuffledQuestionOrder

### StudentAnswers Table - New Columns:
- **Status** (INT) - QuestionStatus enum (0-3)
- **IsMarkedForReview** (BIT) - Review flag
- **AnsweredAt** (DATETIME2) - Timestamp

### Verify in SQL Server Management Studio or Azure Data Studio:
```sql
-- Check TestAttempts table exists
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'TestAttempts'

-- Check StudentAnswers new columns
SELECT COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE 
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS 
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'StudentAnswers'
AND COLUMN_NAME IN ('Status', 'IsMarkedForReview', 'AnsweredAt')
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue: Migration Fails

**Error:** "A network-related or instance-specific error..."

**Solution:**
1. Verify SQL Server is running
2. Check connection string in `appsettings.json`
3. Ensure LocalDB installed (SQL Server Express LocalDB)

```bash
# Check if LocalDB is installed
sqllocaldb info

# If not, install SQL Server Express with LocalDB
```

---

### Issue: Tables Not Created

**Error:** Migration runs but tables missing

**Solution:**
1. Check if migration file was created in `Migrations` folder
2. Verify `database update` completed successfully
3. Check database connection:

```sql
-- In SQL Server Management Studio / Azure Data Studio
SELECT name FROM sys.databases WHERE name = 'CETExamDB';
SELECT * FROM sys.tables WHERE name = 'TestAttempts';
```

---

### Issue: Student Can't See Tests

**Possible Causes:**
1. Test not allocated to student
2. Test scheduled for future time
3. Test already completed

**Solution:**
1. As Admin: Check Test Allocations
2. Verify student is in the allocation
3. Check scheduled times
4. Create new test if needed

---

### Issue: Timer Not Working

**Possible Causes:**
1. JavaScript disabled
2. Browser compatibility
3. Console errors

**Solution:**
1. Enable JavaScript in browser
2. Check browser console (F12)
3. Try different browser
4. Clear cache and reload

---

### Issue: Answers Not Saving

**Possible Causes:**
1. Network error
2. Server error
3. Session expired

**Solution:**
1. Check network tab in browser dev tools
2. Check server logs for errors
3. Re-login if session expired
4. Verify `SaveAnswer` endpoint works

---

### Issue: LaTeX Not Rendering

**Possible Causes:**
1. MathJax not loading
2. Network blocked CDN
3. Syntax errors in LaTeX

**Solution:**
1. Check if MathJax CDN accessible
2. View browser console for errors
3. Test with simple LaTeX: `\( x^2 \)`
4. Verify LaTeX syntax is correct

---

## üìä Database Backup (Recommended)

**Before Migration:**
```sql
-- Backup database before migration
BACKUP DATABASE CETExamDB 
TO DISK = 'C:\Backups\CETExamDB_PreMigration.bak'
WITH FORMAT;
```

**After Migration:**
```sql
-- Backup after successful migration
BACKUP DATABASE CETExamDB 
TO DISK = 'C:\Backups\CETExamDB_PostMigration.bak'
WITH FORMAT;
```

FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'TestAttempts'
ORDER BY ORDINAL_POSITION;

-- Expected columns:
-- Id, TestAllocationId, StudentId, TestId, StartedAt, SubmittedAt,
-- Status, CurrentQuestionIndex, LastActivityAt, ShuffledQuestionOrder

-- 2. Verify StudentAnswers enhancements
SELECT 
    COLUMN_NAME,
    DATA_TYPE,
    IS_NULLABLE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'StudentAnswers'
AND COLUMN_NAME IN ('Status', 'IsMarkedForReview', 'AnsweredAt');

-- Expected 3 rows

-- 3. Check all relationships
SELECT 
    fk.name AS ForeignKey,
    tp.name AS ParentTable,
    cp.name AS ParentColumn,
    tr.name AS ReferencedTable,
    cr.name AS ReferencedColumn
FROM sys.foreign_keys AS fk
INNER JOIN sys.tables AS tp ON fk.parent_object_id = tp.object_id
INNER JOIN sys.tables AS tr ON fk.referenced_object_id = tr.object_id
INNER JOIN sys.foreign_key_columns AS fkc ON fk.object_id = fkc.constraint_object_id

INNER JOIN sys.columns AS cr ON fkc.referenced_column_id = cr.column_id AND fkc.referenced_object_id = cr.object_id
WHERE tp.name = 'TestAttempts';

-- Expected 3 foreign keys from TestAttempts

-- 4. Test data integrity
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TestAttempts) AS TestAttempts,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM StudentAnswers) AS StudentAnswers,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TestAllocations) AS TestAllocations,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Tests) AS Tests,
